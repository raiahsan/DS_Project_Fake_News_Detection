# DS_Project_Fake_News_Detection
A transformer-based fake news detection system using BERT and RoBERTa, compared with traditional ML models.

Fake News Detection Using Transformer Models leverages BERT and RoBERTa to classify news as real or fake, comparing their performance with traditional machine learning models. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation, along with train, validation, and test datasets.

Install dependencies using:

pip install torch transformers datasets scikit-learn pandas numpy
Run the project using:

Results show that transformer models outperform traditional approaches in detecting fake news. Licensed under MIT.
